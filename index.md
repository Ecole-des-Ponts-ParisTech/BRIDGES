# Welcome on the homepage of **BRIDGES**.

BRIDGES is a framework developped by l'Ecole des Ponts ParisTech and its Build'in platform. The framework is intended to provide design and analysis tools in structural mechanics, physical modelling, geometry processing, machine learning and robotics. BRIDGES is cross-platform, meaning that it can be used on different OS and machines. A basic geometry kernel is implemented to make the use of the framework independent from any modelling software.
