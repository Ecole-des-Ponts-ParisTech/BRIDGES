# Overview

`BRIDGES` is based several namespaces:
- `BRIDGES.Algebra` : Contains interfaces defining the mathematical algebraic structures which allow the manipulation of element in a generic way.
- `BRIDGES.Arithmetic` : Contains number type structures, as well as class representation of univariate and multivariate polynomials useful for geometric manipulations.
- `BRIDGES.DataStructure` : Contains structures used to for the representation of surfaces.
- `BRIDGES.Geometry` : Contains interfaces, classes and structures representing object in different geometric spaces.
- `BRIDGES.LinearAlgebra` : Contains implementation of basic objects for linear algebra and algorithm to solve linear problems.
